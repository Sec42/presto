This program was created as an example that write access to /dev/kmem
is all you need :)

so, as quick "chmod a+w /dev/kmem" as root will keep you a nice beckdoor :)

presto runs on FreeBSD only at the moment -- sorry still have to do 
a linux version. It was tested on FreeBSD 2.1.0-Release 

it changes the real uid and effective uid of any process runing to a
user specified value.

Switches:
	-M /dev/kmem	speciefies an alternate location for an writable kmem
	-p pid		which process to modify, 
			default = ppid i.e. the shell you call it from
	-u uid		uid to change to, default = 0
	-e uid		Only change effective-uid
	-d 		print some debugging stuff
	-h		short help

CU & have fun
