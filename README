Welcome to the third release of presto.

Presto changes the real/effective uid of any running process to a
user specified value.

At first I created this as an 'proof of concept' that write access to
/dev/kmem is enough to get root. Some people refused to belive anything
until they see it. And it was fun to write.

After I wrote it, i found it very handy for situations where I
vi a file in /etc, and when I want to save my changes, I notice that I
wasn't root, so I'm not allowed to write to it.

With presto you can just promote the vi to root with presto, and voila!
If you use 'sudo' it is as simple as ':!sudo presto' from inside vi,
the default parameters just do the right thing in this case.

Presto only runs on FreeBSD (i386) at the moment -- sorry.
Linux is far to different to port this there.
It should be possible to run it on Net/OpenBSD too. You might want to
take a look at the *.diff files to see the relevant tricks.

This version now contains a patch to run on FreeBSD-4.2.

Switches:
	-M /dev/kmem	speciefies an alternate location for an writable kmem
	-p pid		which process to modify, 
			default = ppid i.e. the shell you call it from
	-u uid		uid to change to, default = 0
	-e uid		Only change effective-uid (does not show in ps)
	-d 		print some debugging stuff
	-h		short help

CU & have fun
