Welcome to the second release of presto.

At first I created this as an 'proof of concept' that write access to
/dev/kmem is enough to get root. Some people refuse to belive anything
until they see it.

After I wrote it, i found it very handy for these situations where you
vi a file, and on save&exiting notice the file is not writable by you.
Just promote the vi to root with presto, and voila!

Presto only runs on FreeBSD (i386) at the moment -- sorry.
Linux is far to different to port this there.
It should be possible to run it on Net/OpenBSD too. You might want to
take a look at kvm.diff to see the relevant tricks.

I tested it on FreeBSD 3.2-STABLE and 4.1-STABLE, but it should run on any
3.x/4.x system.

it changes the real uid and effective uid of any process runing to a
user specified value.

Switches:
	-M /dev/kmem	speciefies an alternate location for an writable kmem
	-p pid		which process to modify, 
			default = ppid i.e. the shell you call it from
	-u uid		uid to change to, default = 0
	-e uid		Only change effective-uid (does not show in ps)
	-d 		print some debugging stuff
	-h		short help

CU & have fun
